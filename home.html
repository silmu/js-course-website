                <p>&emsp; I have always been interested in how web,
                    mobile and computer applications work. My main
                    interests varied from curiosity about the code
                    behind applications to how the graphical elements
                    are made. When I was 12 I was introduced to HTML
                    and Adobe Photoshop in an after school computer club.
                    Unfortunately, back then Software Engineering was not
                    taught at any vocationals schools in my city. I continued
                    studying HTML and CSS on my own and building simple web sites. 
                </p>
                <p>&emsp; Later on I was focused on developing my career as a
                    graphic designer. At the same time I was studying Python
                    online courses for beginners. In 2013 I got a job as a web
                    designer at a start up web studio. In 2014 I started working
                    as a web designer at the "Internet Solutions" company. I was
                    working as a freelance graphic designer from 2014 till 2019.
                    My clients included WikiHow, EmoakStudio, Games2Win, Starfall
                    Team, Peachy Games. My main specialization was creating
                    graphical elements for game applications. In 2019 I moved
                    to Finland to live with my spouse. Almost immediately I
                    started learning Finnish and thinking about changing my
                    career to web development.

            <section><h4>Education and skills</h4>
                <p>Firstly, I took courses in the Open University of Helsinki:</p>
                <ul class="d-inline-block text-truncate" style="max-width: 500px;">

                    </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>This course was on Java language. Theoretical part
                                was done on MOOC.fi and practical in NetBeans
                                application. The course offered knowledge on
                                variables, conditional statements (if, else if),
                                loops (for, while), arrays, lists, reading user
                                input, reading from a file, methods, Object Oriented
                                Programming, constructors, linear search and binary
                                search algorithms.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="https://course.elementsofai.com" target="_blank">"Introduction to AI" (2op).</a></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This course provided general knowledge about AI, AI
                            problem solving, probability, Bayes' theorem and
                            machine learning.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <p>Secondly, I took courses in Metropolia Open University:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Python Programming" (3op), </li>
                    <li>"C Programming"(3op), </li>
                    <li>"C++ Programming"(3op), </li>
                    <li>"PHP Programming"(3op),</li>
                    <li>"SQL and Relational Databases"(3op),</li>
                    <li>"Engineering mathematics"(5op), </li>
                    <li>"Introduction to Kotlin"(3op),</li>
                    <li><a href="https://techclass.com/academy/courses/10" target="_blank">"Developing Modern Web Platforms(HTML-CSS-JS)(15op)."</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>&emsp; As you can see, I was a bit confused in what direction I was going. However,
                    studying different languages helped me to see the similarities and differences between
                    them. Studying PHP helped me to combine it with my knowledge of HTML and CSS. "SQL and
                    Relational Databases" course introduced me to the XAMPP stack which helped me to deploy
                    my at home server.

            <section><h4>Career plan:</h4>
            <p>&emsp; I plan to focus on a career as a Full Stack Web Developer after I improve
                my skills in JS, PHP and learn about the necessary frameworks and platforms. Additionally,
                I would like to build my own portfolio to show my competence as a Web Developer. For this
                reason I will probably apply first to Front End Developer positions to gain some experience.
                Afterwards, I will move towards Back End Developer positions mastering both and eventually
                getting a job as a Full Stack Web Developer.</p>
